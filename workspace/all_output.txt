For creating unit tests for the "Hello, World!" console application in C#, we can use MSTest which is Microsoft's testing tool for C#.

1. Add a new project in the same solution.
2. Select "MSTest - Test Project" as the type of the new project.
3. Write your test cases, call the function to be tested, and verify the return values.

Your testing project might look like this:

```csharp
using Microsoft.VisualStudio.TestTools.UnitTesting;
using HelloWorld;  // replace HelloWorld with your main project's namespace

namespace HelloWorldTest
{
    [TestClass]
    public class UnitTest1
    {
        [TestMethod]
        public void TestMethod1()
        {
            Program obj= new Program();
            Assert.AreEqual("Hello, World!", obj.Main());
        }
    }
}
```

You will need to adjust your original program to return the string, and not just write it in the console:

```csharp
using System;

namespace HelloWorld
{
    class Program
    {
        static string Main()
        {
            return "Hello, World!";
        }
    }
}
```

To run your test, go to the "Test" menu and click on "Run All Tests". Bar colors and test results will tell you if your tests pass or fail. In our case, the test should pass, as the "Hello, World!" does match the string being returned by our function.
