To create a "Hello, World!" console application in C#, you need to follow these steps:

1. Open Visual Studio and choose "Create a new project".
2. Choose "Console App (.NET Core)" as the project type.
3. Give your project a name and choose a location to save it in, then press "Create".
4. Now you will be in the code editor with a `Program.cs` file created by default. 
5. Here, you will see a `Main` method. This method is the entry point of your application.

Your code should look like this:

```CSharp
using System;

namespace HelloWorld
{
    class Program
    {
        static void Main(string[] args)
        {
            Console.WriteLine("Hello, World!");
        }
    }
}
```

1. To run this code, press F5 or click "Start Debugging" from the Debug menu. The console window should appear and display "Hello, World!".
2. To stop this code, press the "Stop Debugging" button or close the console window.

Remember, `Console.WriteLine` is used to write or display any output on the console screen and `"Hello, World!"` is the string of text to be displayed. The `Main` method is where the execution of program starts in a console application. 

This is a very simple application and is often used as a beginner's first program to test if their development environment is set up correctly.
